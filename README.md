# Lesson Planning (by Dad)
-----------------
- I try to spend roughly 20-40 mins outlining each lesson.  Although I've been programming for 15+ years, I'm new to Unity and it's a learning experience for me as well.
- Most of the time I implement the lesson before sitting down with the kids, but sometimes I just wing it.
- You can find my rough outlines [here](./Docs/LessonPlans.md)
